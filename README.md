# CanvasCalFix

CanvasCalFix is a Chrome extension that solves the frustration of constantly having to re-enable your preferred courses in the Canvas calendar view. It automatically keeps your selected courses visible, even across different Canvas instances and institutions.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files
5. The CanvasCalFix icon will appear in your Chrome toolbar

## Usage

1. Click the CanvasCalFix icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. Add any Canvas URLs you use (e.g., `https://myschool.instructure.com`)
3. Navigate to a Canvas calendar page
4. Open the extension popup and select which courses you want to keep visible
5. Click "Save Selection"

The extension will now automatically ensure these courses remain enabled whenever you visit a Canvas calendar, even if you switch between different Canvas instances.

## Why This Exists

Canvas has a frustrating tendency to uncheck calendar items, especially when you're using multiple Canvas instances for different institutions (I personally have 4 different Canvas instances across two institutions). This extension eliminates the need to constantly re-check the courses you want to see.
